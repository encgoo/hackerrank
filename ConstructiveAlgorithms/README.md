## Flipping the Matrix
The keypoint of this [problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/flipping-the-matrix/problem) is that we
need to find the max element is all four symmetric locations.

## New Year Chaos
The keypoint for this [problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/new-year-chaos/problem) is to add 
an index to each element of the list, and then sort the list according to the
element. Another keypoint here is that when we hanlde the current location (c_location)
and its pre-sorted location (p_location) anything outside (p_location, c_location) won't 
be affected.
